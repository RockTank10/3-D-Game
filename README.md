# 3-D-Game

This is a 3-D platforming game. You use the standard moving keys of WASD. The game uses a third person camera which you can lightly rotate. Space bar is how you jump. While there is no dying or keeping score if you fall off the level you can press one of (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7) each correspoding to a check point(indicated by a green sqaure). 0 is the start and 7 is the end. Have fun!
